    "2. This estimation of the strength of our Higgs signal is actually rather overoptimistic! This is because we are only accounting for one bacground (albeit the strongest one). The next-strongest background is top quark production, identified by the presence of **bjets** (showers of strongly interacting particles originating from a bottom quark), which themselves are identified by the `jet` `MV2c10` algorithm. \n",
    "    - Adjust the `hWW()` function to only allow through events if there is no jet with an `MV2c10` score > 0.18 (indicating the likelihood a jet is a bjet), in the central region ($|\\eta|<2.5$) with a $p_T > 20$ GeV."
