    "We have a theory that a more complicated interaction occurs between a quark, $q$, and an antiquark, $\\bar{q}$. We think that they come towards each other, and quickly exchange a particle (the vertical line below). When this happens, the quark and antiquarks turn into $Z^0$s, which then decay themselves, exactly as in the last analysis. Notice that the part of the Feynman diagram within the box is exactly the same as the diagram in Notebook 4!\n",

    "Now, real experiments are not run like this. You may have noticed that although we mentioned a theoretical decay, all we gave you was a diagram. You had no real way of checking whether or not the decay that the theory described is actually what happens in reality, other than saying that the plots look roughly about right.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one more thing. Surprise! The data you have been analysing here isn't really data at all - it is in fact a simulated sample of $Z^0 \\rightarrow \\ell\\bar{\\ell}$ and $Z^0 Z^0 \\rightarrow \\ell\\bar{\\ell}\\ell\\bar{\\ell}$ decays in the ATLAS detector, based on the Standard Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we perform actual experiments, is that we write some analysis code, just like above, and then run the exact same code on a Standard Model simulation and on the real data that gets spat out by the detector. The extent to which the two agree then tells us how close our model is to reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of what happens if we compare the simulation with what we see at the LHC. The black dots are the real data, and the bars are real data. You may notice that it looks pretty close to what we had before - that's because there are lots and lots of Z decays that happen in the detector. If you looked closely enough, you would be able to tell that there are other colours stacked there in the histogram, but the slices are so thin that you can't see them.\n",
