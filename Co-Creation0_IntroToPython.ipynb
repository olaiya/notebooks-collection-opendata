    "Being able to code is an essential skill for a Particle Physicist (or any scientist, for that matter).  Our datasets are simply too large to process without the assistance of computers!  An ATLAS Physicist typically uses some combination of the C++ and Python programming languages to accomplish everything from simulating proton-proton collisions to searching for Higgs bosons.\n",
    "\n",
    "As being code-literate is a prerequisite to analysing ATLAS data, we will in this notebook review some of the basics of coding in Python.  We will do this by presenting a diluted and interactive version of the tutorial of the [official Python documentation][PyTutorial].  For more information on any topic, let the official Python documentation be your first port of call.  We will link to specific parts of the tutorial as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is extensively used by beginners and software engineers alike, for both business and pleasure.  It can be fun!  It is named after the BBC series \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" and refers to its founder as a Benevolent Dictator For Life ([BDFL][BDFL]).\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have very quickly gone from zero to sixty at coding in Python!  We have been working in a Jupyter notebook where we can run code interactively and write text to annotate what we are doing.  After saying `'Hello, World!'`, we learned how to do maths with Python and how to use strings and compound data types.  By using control flow statements, we saw that we can write quite complex programmes, which we can organise into functions and modules for convenience and shareability!\n",
    "\n",
    "On all of these features, we were brief so that we can get on to more interesting topics quickly.  To that end, we omitted or glossed over many details and many technicalities - there is much more to learn!  But independently learning how to do something new can be a part of the fun and is certainly a part of the job.  When coding, it is normal to not immediately know how to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "In using Python, you are a part of a large global community.  This means that the internet is full of advice on how to write Python code well.  Describing your problem to a search engine more often than not brings up a solution straight away.  Make use of what other Pythonistas know about Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck analysing ATLAS Open Data!  We hope that this _Introduction to coding in Python_ will serve you well."
