An ATLAS Physicist typically uses some combination of the C++ and Python programming languages to accomplish everything from simulating proton-proton collisions to searching for Higgs bosons.\n",

    "As being code-literate is a prerequisite to analysing ATLAS data, we will in this notebook review some of the basics of coding in Python.  We will do this by presenting a diluted and interactive version of the tutorial of the [official Python documentation][PyTutorial].  For more information on any topic, let the official Python documentation be your first port of call.  We will link to specific parts of the tutorial as we go along.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have been writing small snippets of disposable code and executing them, before moving on and forgetting about them.  When it comes to writing a more elaborate programme, it is more convenient to put your code in a file.  When a file is populated with Python definitions, it becomes a [_module_][module] which can be _imported_ from other Python-speaking files such that its content may be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module-oriented approach to software development has the effect of keeping your code organsied, but more importantly facilitates code-sharing.  In the world of open-source and free software, much of the code you will ever need to write has already been written and is available to use!  One rarely has to code everything from scratch.  \n",
