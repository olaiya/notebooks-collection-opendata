    "### For an introduction to the ideas behin $Z^0$ finding, click <a href=\"Events/ZPath.pdf\"> here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The following analysis is searching for events where one (or two) [$Z^0$ bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) decay to two (or four) leptons of same flavour and opposite charge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might recall, leptons can be either electrons or muons, or their antiparticles. **Flavour** just means whether a particle is an (anti)electron or a (anti)muon. We know the $Z^0$ boson has charge zero, so, to conserve charge, the two leptons to which a single $Z^0$ decays must have **opposite charges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also say that electron number and muon number must be conserved in this reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Electrons and antielectrons (positrons) have $+1$ and $-1$ respectively as their electron numbers, and have zero muon number.\n",
    "* Muons and antimuons have $+1$ and $-1$ respectively as their muon numbers, and have zero electron number.\n",
    "* Z^0$ has zero electron number and muon number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we see that if the $Z^0$ decays to two leptons, **they must be the same flavour**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the two-lepton decay first, and then you will have a go with the four-lepton case. First, though, we need to think about how we talk about decays in particle physcis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feynman diagrams and Lorentz vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "We show decays with a [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram), which (for our purposes) we can think of a diagram of the interaction itself, where time goes from left to right. This is not strictly true, but it will suffice for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each particle is a single line, and you can think of the vertical axis as space, so here we have an electron $e^-$ and its antiparticle, a positron, $e^+$, moving towards each other in space, annihilating each other, producing a photon ($\\gamma$) and then that photon decays to two muons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<CENTER><img src=\"./images/electronpositronannihilation.png\" style=\"width:50%\"></CENTER>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that the arrow for the positron is the wrong way round for the process which we have just described. By convention, the arrow for an antiparticle is reversed. (If you really want to know, it's because an antiparticle can be thought of as a particle moving backwards in time - something which we will not go into here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we say that energy and momentum must be conserved at each vertex in the Feynman diagram. $\\vec{p}^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{before} = \\vec{p}^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{after}$, and $E^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{before} =E^\\mathrm{tot}_\\mathrm{after}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concise way of writing that is with a **Lorentz vector**, or 4-vector, which neatly packages together energy and momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P^\\mu = (E/c, \\vec{p}) = (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\mu$ is just an arbitrary index, starting at zero, so $P^0 = E/c$, $P^1 = p_1 = p_x$, $P^2 = p_2 = p_y$, $P^3 = p_3 = p_z$. However, we make sure to write it to make it clear that this is no ordinary spatial vector that we're dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add and subtract these four-vectors like any other vector with four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P^\\nu_{e^+} + P^\\nu_{e^-} = (E_{e^+} + E_{e^-}, \\vec{p}_{e^+} + \\vec{p}_{e^-}) = P^\\nu_\\mathrm{tot}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all of its components must be conserved, $P^\\mu_\\mathrm{before} = P^\\mu_\\mathrm{after}$ at every vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the electron-positron annihilation above, conserving 4-momentum at each vertex, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P^\\nu_{e^+} + P^\\nu_{e^-} = P^\\nu_\\gamma\\text{, and } P^\\nu_\\gamma =  P^\\nu_{\\mu^+} +  P^\\nu_{\\mu^-}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "More interestingly, if you remember the most famous equation in Physics, $E=mc^2$. That's only true if an object is stationary. If it's not, you have $E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2$. The $m$ in this is called its invariant mass. Clearly, you can quite easily construct $m$ from the components of the 4-vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\sqrt{E^2 - p^2 c^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Units\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing - we can just pick a system of units in which $c = 1$. We basically do this by redefining what our SI units are. Imagine that we measured distances in pirate-wizards, which we define to be equal to $299 792 458$ metres. Let's keep measuring times in seconds, though. You, then are about $6\\times 10^{-9}$ pirate-wizards tall.\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's then define the unit of energy as 1 GeV - one gigaelectronvolt. hat does that make our unit of mass? Now, we know that the units still have to match up dimensionally, and we know that $1 kg = 1 Joule /c^2$, so let's measure mass in $eV /c^2$. Similarly, let's measure momentum in $eV/c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can measure some particle A to have a mass of $3 GeV/c^2$, an energy of $5 GeV/c^2$, and a momentum of $4 GeV/c$. The advantage of setting $c=1$ is that we can throw out all of those extra $c$s. That means we can measure everything in units  of $GeV$! So, our particle A just has $m=3$, $E=5$, and $p=4$. Of course, you can't do dimensional analysis any more, but it makes a lot of things easier - trust me. For one thing, our mass equation turns out to be pretty simple: $m = \\sqrt{E^2 - p^2}$. \n",
